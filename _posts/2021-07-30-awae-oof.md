Welp, AWAE 3, devnull 0.
![welp](../images/sad_morty.jpg "welp")

## TL;DR
OffSec had me in the first half...and in the second half:(

Also, this aint nothing like the OSCP, FYI.

## Where the vulns at?
I still think OffSec gave me the "fixed" apps, but thats not the case; I guess.

![lost](../images/lost.gif "im lost")

I swear I found a couple ways to the initial vuln but I kept running into dead ends, so maybe they were the rabbit holes Ive read about? All I know is my head hurt after the whole thing.

## Goin Forward
Im going to focus on several things:
- PortSwigger Web Academy (again)
- Juiceshop (running on my home lab now)
- DVWA (also running on my home lab)
- Read write-ups related to what might have gotten me in the apps?
  - XSS write-ups
  - SQLi write-ups
  - Authentication Bypass write-ups
  - Making Old Fashions 101 write-ups?
- Try harder?
